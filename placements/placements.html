			<h1>Training & Placements</h1>
			<p>Flight training is a course of study used when learning to pilot an aircraft. The overall purpose of
				primary and intermediate flight training is the acquisition and honing of basic airmanship skills.Flight
				training can be conducted under a structured accredited syllabus with a flight instructor at a flight
				school or as private lessons with no syllabus with a flight instructor as long as all experience
				requirements for the desired pilot certificate/license are met.</p>

				<h1>Placement Cell</h1>
				<p>The design process starts with the aircraft's intended purpose. Commercial airliners are designed for
					carrying a passenger or cargo payload, long range and greater fuel efficiency where as fighter jets
					are designed to perform high speed maneuvers and provide close support to ground troops. Some
					aircraft have specific missions, for instance, amphibious airplanes have a unique design that allows
					them to operate from both land and water, some fighters, like the Harrier Jump Jet, have VTOL
					(vertical take-off and landing) ability, helicopters have the ability to hover over an area for a
					period of time.</p>

				<h1>Training Programmes</h1>
				<p>The two seating configurations for trainer aircraft are: pilot and instructor side by side, or in
					tandem, usually with the pilot in front and the instructor behind. The side-by-side seating
					configuration has the advantage that pilot and instructor can see each other's actions, allowing the
					pilot to learn from the instructor and the instructor to correct the student pilot. The tandem
					configuration has the advantage of being closer to the normal working environment that a fast jet
					pilot is likely to encounter.</p>

				<h1>Recruiters</h1>
				<p>There were 290,000 airline pilots in the world in 2017 and aircraft simulator manufacturer CAE Inc.
					forecasts a need for 255,000 new ones for a population of 440,000 by 2027, 150,000 for growth and
					105,000 to offset retirement and attrition : 90,000 in Asia-Pacific (average pilot age in 2016: 45.8
					years), 85,000 in Americas (48 years), 50,000 in Europe (43.7 years) and 30,000 in Middle East &
					Africa (45.7 years).</p>

				<h1>MOU</h1>
				<p>One advantage of MoUs over more formal instruments is that, because obligations under international
					law may be avoided, they can often be put into effect without requiring legislative approval. Hence,
					MoUs are often used to modify and adapt existing treaties, in which case these MoUs have factual
					treaty status.[8] The decision concerning ratification, however, is determined by the parties'
					internal law and depends to a large degree on the subject agreed upon. MoUs that are kept
					confidential (i.e., not registered with the UN) cannot be enforced before any UN organ, and it may
					be concluded that no obligations under international law have been created.</p>
